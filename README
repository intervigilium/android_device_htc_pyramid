Ice Cream Sandwich Device tree for HTC Pyramid (Sensation)

Kernel:
-HTC 3.0.16 kernel from 3.30 leak

Current issues:
-wifi tethering doesn't work
-bluetooth doesn't work
-camcorder doesn't work

Misc issues:
-Invensys MPU cannot be built from source since we do not have access to
 HTC kernel module IOCTLs, using sensors.pyramid from 3.30 leak
-Audio built from source, but there seems to be problems with voice search,
 voice text input, etc
-Video playback is possible using 3.30 leak OMX libs, but OMX from source
 results in a segfault
-It should be theoretically possible for wifi calling to work, since the
 kineto.ko module exists
