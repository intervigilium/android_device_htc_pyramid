Ice Cream Sandwich device tree for HTC Pyramid (Sensation)

Kernel:
-HTC 3.0.16 kernel from 3.32 leak

Current issues:
-wifi tethering doesn't work
-bluetooth doesn't work
-camcorder doesn't work

Misc issues:
-Invensys MPU cannot be built from source since we do not have access to
 HTC kernel module IOCTLs, using sensors.pyramid from 3.32 leak
-Audio recording no longer crashes, but it doesn't seem to record anything
-Video playback is possible using 3.32 leak OMX libs or using ics-omx
 frameworks/base branch, but OMX from ics-test branch results in a segfault
-It should be theoretically possible for wifi calling to work, since the
 kineto.ko module exists

Building:
-frameworks/base, branch ics-omx
-hardware/libhardware, branch ics-chocolate
-hardware/msm7k, branch ics-test
-hardware/qcom/display, branch ics-chocolate
-hardware/qcom/media, branch ics-test
