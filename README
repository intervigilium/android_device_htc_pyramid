Ice Cream Sandwich device tree for HTC Pyramid (Sensation)

Kernel:
- osp-stock

Current issues:
-wifi tethering doesn't work
-camcorder doesn't work

Misc issues:
-Invensys MPU cannot be built from source since we do not have access to
 HTC kernel ioctl definitions, must use sensors.pyramid from 3.32 leak
-Video playback is possible using 3.32 leak OMX libs or using ics-omx
 frameworks/base branch, but OMX from ics-test branch results in a segfault
-Overlay (liboverlay) does not initialize correctly due to different or
 missing MSMFB_MIXER_INFO ioctl in HTC kernel, should probably be left off.
-It should be theoretically possible for wifi calling to work, since the
 kineto.ko module is built in
